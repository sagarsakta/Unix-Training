8.15 User Identification

In a program, sometimes we want to know the login name of the user along with its userID and groupID.So, we have one function as 'getlogin' .It is used when a single user has multiple login names with the same userID. However ,if their is a single entry of a user we can use 'getpwuid' function as well.

8.16 Process Scheduling

Kernel defines some policies and priorties for each and every process.The process can choose to run in lower priority by adjusting to its nice value.Normally , nice values are ranges from 0 to (2*NZERO)-1.Lower nice value will have higher scheduling priority.NZERO is the default nice value of the system.

A process can retrieve and change its nice value by having nice function.The single process can adjust only to its own nice value it will not affect to other process.

8.17 Process Times

We know that any process can call the 'times' function to obtain these values for itself and any of its children.
