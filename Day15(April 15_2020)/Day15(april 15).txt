10.1 Introduction

In the advance programming of UNIX environment Signals are related to interrupts.They can provide a way of handling asynchronous events.There are several types of signals and in this chapter we will describe which signal is used for which purpose.

10.2 Signal Concepts

All signals which are available in the UNIX environment are begin with three special characters 'SIG'.

Signal names are defined by positive integer constants and under header file <signal.h>.It's nvalue will never be 0.

Several Conditions can generate signals:

a.Terminal generated Signals- When user press the Delete key on the terminal.It is also used to stop the runaway programs.

b.Hardware exceptions generate signals- It refers to wrong memory reference or we can say divide by 0 interrupt. SIGSEGV signal is used for executing an invalid memory refrence.

c.Software can generate signals-When process have to handle various asynchronous events like when alarm clock expires, when there is a issue regarding network .

d. kill(1)- It is a function which allows us to send signals to other processes.

e. kill(2)- It is a function which allows a process to send any signal to another process group.But we have to be a owner or superuser of the process.
