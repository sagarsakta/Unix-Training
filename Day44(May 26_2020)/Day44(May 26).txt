18.1 Introduction to Terminal I/O

In this section we will study about all the terminal functions and all platform-specific additions which are made.The increment in the complixity of Terminal I/O has many several reasons like the use of terminal I/O has been increased. It has one of the longest manuals in the Unix environment.


18.2 Overview

There are several modes which are used in the Terminal I/O. 
1. Canonical mode- It is a mode which is used by default .We use the standard read and write to copy the input to the output . 
2. Noncanonical mode- It is a that processing of input in which the input is not assembled into lines as it manipulate the entire screen.


18.3 Special input Characters

We have several special characters out of which 9 of them to any other value that the user want.
1.CR- The carriage return character.
2.DISCARD- The discard character.
3.DSUSP- The delayed-suspend job control character.
4.EOF- The end of file character.
5.EOL-The additional line delimiter character.
6.EOL2- Another delimiter character.
7.ERASE- The erase character.
8.INTR- The interrupt character.
9.KILL- The kill character.
10.LNEXT- The literal-next character.
11.NL- The newline character.
12.QUIT-The quit character.
13.REPRINT- The reprint character.
14.START- The start character.
15.STATUS- The status request character.
16.STOP- The stop character.
17.SUSP- The suspend job control character.
18.WERASE- The word-erase character.


18.4 Getting and Setting Terminal Attributes

There are two functions which are used in the structure to get and set the structure -
1. tcgetattr
2. tcsetattr
These functions takes a pointer to a structure then returns the attributes and returns -1 if file descriptors does not exist.


18.5 Terminal Option Flags

There are several flags in which four terminal flags fields the option appears.All the flags specify one or multiple bits .
There are six delay values which is supported by Linux
1.BSDLY
2.CRDLY
3.FFDLY
4.NLDLY
5.TABDLY
6.VTDLY


18.6 stty Command

It is a command which is defined as a interface to the various functions like-
1.tcgetattr -It fetches attributes.
2.tcsetattr- It sets attributes.
3.cfgetispeed- It get input speed.
4.cfgetospeed- It get output speed.
5.cfsetispeed- It set input speed.
6.cfsetospeed-It set output speed.


18.7 Baud Rate Functions

Baud rate refers to the bits per second. All terminal devices always use the same baud rate for both input and output.The cfget functions returns the various constants-
B50,B75,B110, B134, B150, B200, B300, B600, B1200, B1800, B2400, B4800, B9600, B19200, B38400.
