UNIX System Signals

1. SIGABRT signal- In this signal process terminates abnormally as it is generated by calling the abort function.

2.SIGALRM signal-It generates automatically when alarm function expires with a timer set.

3.SIGBUS signal- it defines the hardware fault .The process implementations usually generate these signals.

10.3 Signal Function

It is a interface to the signal feature.Its prototype requires two arguements and returns pointer to that function.

First arguement is a 'signo' which is a integer.
The second arguement is a pointer to a function that takes a integer and returns nothing.


10.4 Unreliable Signals

Sometimes ,signals can be lost so the process will never know about the signal that it has been occured.We can catch the signal or it can ignore the signal as well.
