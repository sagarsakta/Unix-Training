8.12 Interpreter Files

These Files are test files that begin with a line of the form.The most common of these interpreter files begin with the line #!/bin/sh.
The file that gets executed by the kernel is not the interpreter file, the file which is specified by the pathname on the first line is the interpreter file.

Difference between interpreter file and interpreter
a text file that begins with #! is called as interpreter file whereas the interpreter which is specified by the pathname on the first line of the interpreter file.

8.13 System Function
 
Suppose we want to put a timestamp on any file we use time to get the current calender time then call localtime to convert it to a broken-down time, then call strftime to format the result, and finally we write the result. So, to regularise it we can simply write system("date > file");
It is defined by ISO C.

8.14 Process Accounting

Every time the process terminates Kernel writes an accounting to it.It includes small amount of binary data with the name of command,CPU Time user and group IDs.

A function which enable and disable process accounting is 'acct'.It is defined in <sys/acct.h>.
