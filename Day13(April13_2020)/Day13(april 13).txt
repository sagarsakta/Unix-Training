9.10 Orphaned Process Groups

We know that a process is called as orphand when its parent process is terminates.

The creation of orphaned process group has several processes and functions,when we implement fork function:

a.The parent process sleeps for 5 seconds.
b.The child establishes a signal handler.
c.The child sends stop signal for itself.
d. Child's parent process ID becomes 1 when the child is orphaned.


9.11 FreeBSD Implementation

Now, in this part we will talk about some features and implementations used by BSD.There is a structure which is labelled for every session.Some of its fields are-

a.a_count-number of process groups in single session.
b.a_leader- a type of pointer to the structure.
c.a_ttyvp- a type of pointer to the vnode.
d. s_sid- it is a session id.

The structure contains following information about any process.
a.p_pid- It contains process ID.
b.p_pptr- pointer to the structure.
c.p_pgrp- points to the structure to which process belong.
