9.8 Job Control

It is a that feature which allow us to run multiple process groups from a single terminal and its work to control the process which is accessing the terminal and which process is running on background.

It supports three forms for its implementation 
a. A shell
b. The terminal driver
c. The Kernel

When we start using job control through shell we can start it in both
foreground and in background as well.

Features of Job Control with foreground and background jobs is  Terminal input output and those signals which are generated by terminal are always connected from the foreground process.


9.9 Shell Execution of Programs

Now, we will do the execution of programs with the help of shell. We will use 'ps' command.The parent of ps command is the shell.Both ps command aqns shell are in the same process group.

For eg- If we execute one command in the background, ps -o pid, ppid, pgid, sid, comm &
 the output will be that changes the process ID of the command.
