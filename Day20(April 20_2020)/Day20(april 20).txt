10.10 alarm and pause Functions

The alarm function is used to set timer for a process .The alarm will expire at a specified time and it will generate the SIGALRM signal and that signal is generated by kernel.

The pause function stops the calling process until signal will be caught.
We can put a process to sleep for a specific time using these alarm and pause functions.

10.11 Signal Sets

It is a type of data type which is used to handle the multiple signals.

There are five different types of functions which are used to manipulate this data type.
a.sigemptyset function- It initializes the signal set so that all signals which can be generated should be exclude.

b.sigfillset function- It initializes the signal set so that all signals which can be generated should be include.

c. sigaddset function- It is called always once for each signal set.

d.sigdelset function- It removes a single signal from a signal set.

e.sigismember function - It test a bit ,the bit which is generated by a sigaddset function.
