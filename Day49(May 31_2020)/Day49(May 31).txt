19.5 pty Program

Whenever we implement our program using pty , that program is executed in its own session.We wil use pty_fork function the execution of the program in which we will fetch the current values of the structure and pass the function arguement to it.
After that child calls the execvp to execute the program and the parent is also used to reset the terminal when exit is called.

a.In Job control Interaction
If we run job control in pty like pty ksh , We can execute our programs in this shell and use job control like our login shell.
For interactive program other than this job control we will use pty cat, it works until we use the job control suspend keyword.

Watching Output of Long Running Programs

We can write pty slowout > file.out &
When program gives output slowly.

b.Script Programs
#!/bin/sh
pty "${SHELL:=/bin/sh}" | tee typescript
We can see all the relationship between processes by this script.
