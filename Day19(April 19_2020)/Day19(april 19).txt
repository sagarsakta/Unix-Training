10.8 Reliable-Signal Terminology and Semantics

When an event causes signal occurs then a signal is generated for a process .Event means like hardware exception, software condition.
When certain actions are taken for signal we can say that signal is delievered to a process.Process can block the delivery of signal.

10.9 Kill and raise Functions

Kill function is used to send a signal to a process.
Raise function allows a process to send a signal to itself.
 
Signal number 0 is called as null signal.If signo arguement is considered as 0 then error checking is performed by kill. If we send the process the null signal and if does not exist kill will return -1.

There can be four different conditions for pid arguement in the kill function:
a.pid>0 - the signal sent to that process whose process ID is pid.

b.pid==0 - the signal is sent to that processes whose process ID is equal to the group ID of sender.

c.pid<0 - the signal is sent to that process whose process ID equals the absolute value of pid.

d. pid==-1- the signal is sent to that processes for which sender has permission to send signal.
