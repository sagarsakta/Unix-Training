11.1 Introduction

In this chapter we will see use of thread of performing several tasks in a single environment process.
In a single process all threads will acess to the same process compnents. The main purpose of running a single process resource with multiple users is for the consistency.


11.2 Thread Concepts

It has a simpe meaning that we know that the process is doing only one thing at a particluar time but with multiple thread of control we can perform more than one thing at a time in a single process.
Our Program is simplified using threads regardless of the number of processor.Thread contains ThreadID (which identify the thread within a process),register values,stack. 
There are some interfaces in thread known as pthreads.


11.3 Thread Identification

We can identify the thread by its thread ID. It belongs to that process which is  currently running and that processID is non negative integer.
Thread ID is denoted by pthread_t data type.It is used to print the threadID during debugging.

It can also achieve its own threadID by calling pthread_self function.It is very useful when we have to identify our data structures.


11.4 Thread Creation

Threads are created using the pthead_create function.The memory is pointed out by tidp is set to threadID when this pthread_create returns.attr arguement is used to customize thread attributes.

Thread runs on a start_rtn function.But,when we call the thread there is no surity is which thread will run , calling one or newly created thread.
