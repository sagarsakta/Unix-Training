10.20 sigqueue Function

It is a function which is used to queuing signals. To use queued signal we have to do some operations:
a. We will specify SA_SIGINFO flag when we have a signal handler.

b. Instead of using usual SA_HANDLER we will provide signal handler in a SA_SIGACTION member of sigaction structure.

c. Using the sigqueue function to send signals.


10.21 Job-Control Signals

There are six job control signals are present-
1. SIGCHLD- means child process has been stopped.
2. SIGCONT- means continue the process if it is stopped.
3  SIGSTOP- means stop the signal.
4. SIGTSTP- means Interactive stop signal.
5. SIGTTIN- means read from controlling terminal.
6. SIGTTOU- means write to controlling terminal.


10.22 Signal Names and Numbers

We will learn how to map Signal name with numbers.Suppose we have an array extern char *sys_siglist[]; . So,the array index is the signal number , which is used to give a pointer to the character string.

For printing the character string we can use psignal function.
